    <p class="intro">BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan), also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a seven-member South Korean
      boy band formed in Seoul in 2013. The septet co-writes and produces
      much of their output. Originally a hip hop group, their musical style
      has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often
      focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental
      health, troubles of school-age youth, loss, the journey
      towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work features
      references to literature and psychological concepts and
      includes an alternative universe storyline. Popular for their live
      performances, the group have staged several world tours. BTS were
      the second best-selling artists of 2018 worldwide according to the IFPI's
      Global Artist Chart, as well as the only non-English speaking artist to enter the chart.
      The group has won Top Social Artist three years in a row and Top Duo/Group at the 26th Billboard Music
      Awards. Featured on Time's international cover as "Next Generation Leaders", BTS has appeared in the magazine's 25 most influential people on the internet (2017–2019) and Time's 100 most influential people in the world (2019), with the outlet giving them the nickname 'Princes of Pop'. Forbes Korea named BTS the most influential celebrities of Korea in 2018, and BTS ranked 43rd in the Forbes Celebrity 100 (2019) as one of the world's top-earning celebrities. As part of their 2019 Love Yourself World Tour, BTS became the first Asian artist ever to headline and sell out Wembley Stadium as well as broke the highest grossing record ever at Rose Bowl Stadium. BTS are worth more than $4.65 billion to South Korea's economy each year, attracting one in every 13 foreign tourists that visit the country, and are cited as one of the key acts boosting global music sales to $19 billion in 2018, a figure not seen since 2006 after digital purchases gained momentum.</p>
