    <h2 id="Gangnam">Gangnam District</h2>
    <p>The Gangnam District (/ˈɡæŋnæm, ˈɡɑːŋnɑːm/, Korean: 강남구; Hanja: 江南區; RR: Gangnam-gu, Korean pronunciation: [kaŋ nam ku]) also anglicized
      as Kangnam is one of the 25local government districts which make up
      the city of Seoul, South Korea. Gangnam literally means "South of the River".
      Gangnam District is the third largest district in Seoul, with an area of 39.5 km2 (15.3 sq mi).
      As of the 2017 census, Gangnam District had a population of 561,052.
      <br><br>
      Gangnam is one of three gu that make up the Greater Gangnam Area along with neighboring Seocho District and Songpa District. Combined, these three gu cover approximately 120 km2 (46 sq mi) of land and had a population of 1,567,881 as of 2010, making up 20% of the area and 15% of the population of Seoul.
      The Gangnam District office has designated two smoke-free zones within the district. The first is the section of Gangnam Boulevard between exit No. 2 of Gangnam Station of Seoul Subway Line 2 and exit No. 5 of Sinnonhyeon Station of Line 9; the second is the 836-meter (914-yard) section of sidewalk along Yeongdong
      Boulevard from exit No. 5 of Samseong Station on Line 2, outside COEX Convention & Exhibition Center and ASEM Tower of the COEX complex.
      <br><br>
      Both the Greater Gangnam Area and Gangnam itself are widely known for its heavily concentrated wealth and very high standard of living, which has been compared to cities such as Beverly Hills, California.[3] The most significant indicator is its extremely expensive real estate. Seoul as a whole is known for its expensive housing prices—as of 2011, its average apartment cost approximately US$5,500 per m2—but the average price in Gangnam is almost twice as high, roughly US$10,000 per m2, which is 3.5 times the nationwide average.[4] As for land value, the mere 40 km2 land of Gangnam district rivals with the entire land value of the city of Busan, the second-largest city in South Korea. Combined with the neighboring districts of Seocho and Songpa, the Greater Gangnam Area accounts for almost 10% of the land value of the entire country.[5]
      While Seoul's traditional business centers such as Central District, Jongno District, Yongsan District and Yeongdeungpo District still maintain their leading roles, Gangnam and its neighboring districts have fast become the new core across all areas of business over the last few decades. KOSPI 200 companies based in Gangnam district include KEPCO, GS Group, Hyundai Department Store Group, HITEJinro, Hansol, Hankook Tire, GLOVIS and Korea Zinc Corporation. Besides, POSCO also operates POSCO Center in Teheran Valley, and KT&G operates Kosmo Tower. Other notable companies based in Gangnam include Dongbu Fire Insurance, Young Poong Group, T'way Airlines and Hankook P&G. Gangnam is also home to many IT and other internet-related companies including NC Soft and Pandora TV, and is also a strong hub of the country's financial and banking sectors. Many international companies also operate key offices in Gangnam, including Google,[6] IBM, Toyota, and AMI.
      Since January 2012, the area has also been home to FNC Entertainment, which moved into its own company offices in Cheongdam-dong, separate from its parent company in the CJ E&M Music Performance Division Building in neighbouring Apgujeong-dong.[7] Other entertainment companies located there include SM Entertainment, JYP Entertainment, Cube Entertainment, Pledis Entertainment, LOEN Entertainment,[8] Source Music, Plan A Entertainment, DSP Media, MBK Entertainment, Nega Network, C-JeS Entertainment, WM Entertainment, NH Media, J. Tune Entertainment, TOP Media, Happy Face Entertainment, Dream Tea Entertainment, Polaris Entertainment, Jellyfish Entertainment, DR Music and Stardom Entertainment.
      The Korean subsidiary of American Megatrends, AMI Korea, is headquartered in Daechidong, Gangnam District.</p>

      <h2 id="Incheon">Incheon</h2>
      <p>ncheon (Korean: 인천; Hanja: 仁川; Korean pronunciation: [intɕʰʌn]; formerly romanized as Inchŏn; literally "kind river"), officially the Incheon Metropolitan City (인천광역시), is a city located in northwestern South Korea, bordering Seoul and Gyeonggi to the east. Inhabited since the Neolithic, Incheon was home to just 4,700 people when it became an international port in 1883. Today, about 3 million people live in the city, making it South Korea's third most-populous city after Seoul and Busan. The city's growth has been assured in modern times with the development of its port due to its natural advantages as a coastal city and its proximity to the South Korean capital. It is part of the Seoul Capital Area, along with Seoul itself and Gyeonggi Province, forming the world's fifth largest metropolitan area by population.
        Incheon has since led the economic development of Korea by opening its port to the outside world, ushering in the modernization of Korea as a center of industrialization. In 2003, the city was designated as Korea's first free economic zone. Since then, large local companies and global enterprises have increasingly invested in the Incheon Free Economic Zone, including Samsung which chose Songdo International City as its new investment destination for its bio industry.
        As an international city, Incheon has held numerous large scale international conferences, such as the Incheon Global Fair & Festival in 2009. The 17th Asian Games Incheon 2014 was also held in Incheon on 19 September 2014. Incheon has established itself as a major transportation hub in northeast Asia with the Incheon International Airport and Incheon Port. The city is also home to the Green Climate Fund, an international organization addressing environmental issues
        <br><br>
        Incheon forms the heart of Capital Industrial Region. During the industrialization of South Korea, several industrial complexes were built throughout the city, and as a result, the city was largely dependent on manufacturing industry. But with the designation of Incheon Free Economic Zone in 2003, the city is now making an effort to foster new growth industries. Major industrial parks include Bupyeong industrial complex, which hosts GM Incheon plant(formerly a GM Daewoo Incheon plant), Juan industrial complex, and Namdong Industrial complex.
        In recent years, bio industry is emerging as a new growth industry of the city. Currently, with the total production capacity of 330kℓ per year, the city ranks 2nd in the world by production capacity along with San Francisco, United States. The capacity is under expansion, and after completion in 2018, the city will rank 1st with the production capacity of 510kℓ.[20] Also, logistics industry is also experiencing a rapid growth, thanks to Incheon Airport, which was ranked fourth in the world by cargo traffic, and the expansion of Incheon Port.
        <br><br>
        The Incheon Free Economic Zone consists of the three regions of Songdo, Cheongna, and the island of Yeongjong, and has a total area of 51,739 acres (20,938 ha). The goal of IFEZ is to transform these three areas into hubs for logistics, international business, leisure, and tourism for the Northeast Asian region. The term 'Free Economic Zone' applies to the development in these three areas with the aim of improving the business environment for foreign-invested enterprises and the living conditions for foreigners. The zone is a specially designated area to create the most favorable business and living environment where foreign nationals can live and invest freely and conveniently. Incheon's Free Economic Zone, the first in Korea, was officially designated by the Korean government in August 2003. IFEZ is planned to be a self-contained living and business district featuring air and sea transportation, a logistics complex, an international business center, financial services, residences, schools and hospitals, and shopping and entertainment centres.

        <h2 id="gu">Gwangjin-gu</h2>
        <p>Gwangjin District (Gwangjin-gu) is one of the 25 wards (gu) of Seoul, South Korea. It is located on the north bank of the Han River, to the eastern end of Seoul It was created from neighboring Seongdong District in 1995.
          Gwangjin District is home to Konkuk University and Sejong University.
          <br><br>
          Gwangjin District is characterized by a remarkable variety in its composition. It is home to the Konkuk University campus, the vicinity of which is one of Seoul's top nightlife destinations, as well as Children's Grand Park, an equally popular attraction for children and families. The south bank overlooking the Han River is a densely packed residential district, where high-rise apartment buildings dominate the skyline, yet the heart and northern end of the district are centers for light industry and manufacturing. The district is also a hub for transportation and mail in and out of Seoul, as the Dong Seoul Bus Terminal and the East-Seoul Postal Service Depot link Seoul with most other major cities in Korea. Most of the remaining area is residential, but consist not of apartment buildings characteristic of the city, but of three or four-story row houses separated by small roads and alleyways.
          The Konkuk University area is a popular nightlife district featuring dozens of restaurants, bars, DVD rooms, and pool houses catering to a mostly younger crowd, much like the areas of Sinchon and Hongdae. The area is also a burgeoning shopping district with several boutiques cropping up within the newly designated Rodeo Street and the opening of the Star City mall, which features an E-Mart, a Lotte Cinema, a Burger King, a Krispy Kreme, a large video game arcade and numerous other restaurants and specialty shops.
          <br><br>

          In the centre of Gwangjin District, There is Gangbyeon underground station. At the left of this station, There is Dong Seoul Bus Terminal. In this Terminal, lots of buses running to many cities and counties - including Busan, Gwangju, Daegu, Daejeon, and more - depart. To the right of this station, there is a huge building selling all kinds of useful electronics called Techno Mart. Many kinds of computers, printers, mobile phones, cameras, MP3 players, and even refrigerators are sold in this building which is like Akihabara in Tokyo.
