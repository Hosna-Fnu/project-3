    <p><i>Seoul</i> the NATIONAL capital of South Korea is the fourth most populated city in the world only behind Tokyo, Mexico City, and New York. Seoul accounts for nearly one fourth the entire population in South Korea. Including its satellite cities, the population of the area is an astounding 46.3% of the entire population. Seoul’s population is also nearly three times to that of Busan, the second largest city. The population of a city is directly proportional to its sphere of influence, and this resulted in the large influx of migrants into Seoul during the 1960-1980 when the economy was booming. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Seoul is a vibrant city – even more so when the sun has set and its population is eager to go out and have fun. In fact, South Koreans truly know how to have fun, as the local nightlife culture has developed a “station system” with a restaurant for dinner being the first station followed by bars, pubs, karaoke rooms, and more food and drinks as subsequent “stations.” It’s not rare that a night in Seoul ends after five or six – or more – different “stations.” Seoul has a multitude of fun nightlife areas, including Itaewon, Hongdae, and Gangnam.</p>
    <br>
    <p>While you may think you have you had great Korean BBQ before, you won’t know what you are talking about until you’ve had authentic Korean BBQ in Seoul. One of the best BBQ restaurants in the city is Wang Bi Jib, serving high-quality marbled cuts of meat seasoned with light salt. Another local favorite is Seocho Myeonok, specializing in galbi jjim. This dish refers to meat slow-cooked in a beef broth. The dish is then served in clay pots with veggies.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Each year, millions of tourists from neighboring Asian countries come to Korea for one sole reason: shopping. They want to pick up the latest trends in Korean fashion, get their hands on high-quality Korean skincare products, and visit one of the many large department stores for the ultimate shopping experience – tax-free! In general, visitors can receive a tax refund at the airport when submitting their receipts at the tax refund booth. However, more and more tax-free stores are popping up in Seoul allowing foreign customers to get immediate tax refunds below a certain limit.</p>
    <br>
    <p>If there’s one thing Seoul has plenty of, it is quirky cafés. Themed cafés first came about a couple of years ago in Seoul’s Hongdae district with the first cat café. Today, the city is filled with themed cafés specializing in animals such as raccoons, dogs, sheep, or meerkats. Other cafés are themed according to a specific cartoon character, such as Hello Kitty or Kakao Friends. Whatever theme you are looking for, you won’t have to look long for a café in Seoul to please you.</p>
