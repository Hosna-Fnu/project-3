    <h3><li>Seoul</li></h3>
    <a href="Seoul.html"><img src="images/photos/seoul.jpg" alt="seoul" weight= 600 height=530 title="Seoul National Capital of South Korea"></a>
    <figcaption><i>A view of Seoul, Capital of South Korea</i></figcaption>
    <p> <i>Seoul</i> is a dynamic city fearlessly forging a path into the future while faithfully preserving its proud past. Home of the world’s fastest internet and some of Asia’s oldest urban enclaves, where 100-floor skyscrapers soar above thousand-year-old Buddhist temples. A harmonious blending of old and new beats at the heart of this world-class destination. Between the balance and the bibimbap comes the ultimate urban excursion. Fashion- and technology-forward but also deeply traditional, this dynamic city mashes up palaces, temples, cutting-edge design and mountain trails, all to a nonstop K-Pop beat.</P>

    <h4><li>Jeju Island</li></h4>

    <figcaption><i>Jeju Island</i></figcaption>
    <p> <i>Jeju Island</i>, also known as the "Island of the Gods," is a popular vacation spot for Koreans and foreigners. It remains the top honeymoon destination for Korean newlyweds. Despite attempts to market the island as "the Hawaii of Korea," climatologically and geographically it bears little in similarity to the Hawaiian Islands in the U.S. The island offers visitors a wide range of activities: hiking on Halla-san (South Korea's highest peak) or Olle-Gil(routes), catching sunrises and sunsets over the ocean, riding horses, touring all the locales from a favorite television K-drama, or just lying around on the sandy beaches.</p>

    <br>
    <h4><li>Incheon</li></h4>
    <a href="Incheon.html"><img src="images/photos/incheon.jpg" alt="Incheon city" weight= 500 height=330 title="Incheon City"></a>
    <figcaption><i>Incheon City</i></figcaption>
    <p> <i>Incheon</i>, a city of Arts, entertainment, fashion, history and nature: Incheon has it all (and more)! The city is undergoing an extravagant real estate development, with a projected finish date of 2015. It also expects a large number of visitors for its 2014 Asian Games. Visitors can peruse designer shops in the Bupyeong district, enjoy events at the Arts Centre or discover local history at Liberty Park and Independence Memorial Hall. Head to the country's only official Chinatown for authentic cuisine and souvenirs. A ferry rides to the nearby islands is the perfect escape from the excitement of the city.
